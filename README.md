# 🏧 Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 

## 📖 Description
This project simulates the operation of an **Automated Teller Machine (ATM)**, focusing on the use of **dynamic data structures** for managing banknotes and transactions. It follows an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach and utilizes **dynamic vectors** as the primary data structure.

---

## ✨ Key Features
### 🔹 **1. Focus on Dynamic Data Structures**
- Implementation of a **Dynamic Vector (`DynamicVector`)**, optimized for efficient element management.
- Use of **collections (`Collection`)** to store and track banknotes with occurrence counting.
- Efficient algorithms for generating and filtering banknote combinations.

### 🔹 **2. ATM Functionalities**
- 🏦 **Display available banknotes** in the ATM.
- 💵 **Perform withdrawals**, selecting the optimal combination of banknotes.
- 🔍 **Show transaction history** of previous operations.
- 📊 **Filter and efficiently manipulate data** using dynamic structures.

### 🔹 **3. Modular and Object-Oriented Architecture**
- **Encapsulation and code reusability** through specialized classes.
- Clear separation of logic into well-defined modules:
  - 📂 `ATM.h/.cpp`: Core ATM logic.
  - 📂 `Transaction.h/.cpp`: Representation and storage of transactions.
  - 📂 `DynamicVector.h`: Implementation of a generic dynamic vector.
  - 📂 `Collection.h`: Management of collections with element counting.
  - 📂 `Tests/`: Unit tests to validate system behavior.
  - 📂 `main.cpp`: Entry point for program execution.

## 🔬 Testing and Validation
The system includes **unit tests** to validate:
- **Operations on `DynamicVector`** (insertion, deletion, access).
- **Handling of `Collection`** with various scenarios.
- **Correct ATM calculations** (withdrawals and banknote combinations).
